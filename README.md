This document is looking at Water quality data and ice content indicators for the Lake Agnes Rock Glacier, CO. A summary of this project and preliminary results can be found [here.](https://briannarick.github.io/dataviz/RCOP_poster_150dpi.jpg)

**Datasets:** 

* Ion concentrations, pH, temperature, and electrical conductivity for seven streams in the basin from summers 2019, 2020, and 2021

* Hydrographs for two streams summers 2019, 2020, and 2021

* Bottom temperature of snow for 3 on rock glacier and 2 off rock glacier (control) temperature loggers capturing winters 2018-19 and 2019-20

* Displacement vectors for the rock glacier between 2019 and 2021, calculated using SfM imagery in QGIS (IMCORR module)
