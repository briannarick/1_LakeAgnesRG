This project is looking at water quality data and ice content indicators for the Lake Agnes Rock Glacier, CO.

In Colorado, rock glaciers vastly outnumber traditional ice glaciers and cover a larger spatial extent, suggesting that they may contain a larger volume of ice than glaciers themselves. In certain basins, the reduced climate sensitivity of rock glaciers and their sustained cold-water input to mountain streams will likely provide a refuge for cold-water aquatic species in a warming climate. 

Comprehensive characterization of the Lake Agnes rock glacier is a first step in understanding the role of rock glaciers in alpine basins within northern Colorado, features which are an often-disregarded component of the alpine water budget. A summary of this project and preliminary results can be found [here.](https://briannarick.github.io/dataviz/RCOP_poster_150dpi.jpg)

**Datasets:** 

* Ion concentrations, pH, temperature, and electrical conductivity for seven streams in the basin from summers 2019, 2020, and 2021 [-- see preliminary results here](https://briannarick.github.io/1_LakeAgnesRG/src/00_waterQA_import.html)

* Hydrographs for two streams summers 2019, 2020, and 2021

* Bottom temperature of snow for 3 on rock glacier and 2 off rock glacier (control) temperature loggers capturing winters 2018-19 and 2019-20

* Displacement vectors for the rock glacier between 2019 and 2021, calculated using SfM imagery in QGIS (IMCORR module)

* Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) for internal rock glacier structure
